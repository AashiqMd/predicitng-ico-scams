# Predicting ICO scams

Code for predicting ICO scams based on cryptocurrency metadata.

To get started:
- get a download code from Alex then run download.py
- run preprocess.py to process the data

## RapidMiner
Aashiq hand-cleaned a version of the dataset to use with RapidMiner. Get the right ID from Alex, then you can load the dataset in and begin experimenting there.

## Pytorch
To run the pytorch code, you'll need to use the `hydra_main.py` file. This sets up the configuration (using hydra rather than argparse).

Install pytorch with the right command from https://pytorch.org/.
